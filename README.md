# 📚 Streak Widget for Iphone

This project is a customizable **iOS widget** built with **Scriptable** that tracks daily progress for a specific activity like **reading**, **meditation**, or **sports**.  
It visually displays your progress as a grid of dots — marking completed, missed, and future days — and keeps a live count of your current activity streak.

This project is inspired by [jvscholz](https://www.youtube.com/@jvscholz/videos).
